            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>We are a team of developers passionate about Pokemon and technology. Our goal is to create the ultimate tool for Pokemon Go players to help them catch 'em all.</p>
            <p>Our app uses real-time data to track the location of Pokemon and display them on a map for users to see. It also allows users to save their favorite spots and share them with friends.</p>
            <p>Thank you for using our app. We hope you enjoy it!</p>
